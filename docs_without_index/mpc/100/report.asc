Dear TronLive,
 
   It’s ready now. Can you add `tronz_mpc` as friend in keybase ? So that we can contact with each other more conveniently.

Hi TRONZ, we actually still want to participate in this as we followed your last email response and waiting for you to send us a "ready" email when you guys are ready.
So, can we know if it is ready for us to participate? If so, what is the best time?
How many participants do we have now as of March 23 so we can keep a record?
Thanks.

Hi TRONZ, this is TronLive - the first TRON community site.

We would like to participate in MPC project and we are currently preparing a simple-to-follow guide so any Tronics who wish to participate in this project can easily be part of the TRONZ MPC torch participants. Our initiative is to encourage more Tronics to be part of this event and set new Guinness World Record of the largest MPC ever created.

Our available time is Mon - Sun 8am - 8pm (UTC+8). Feel free to contact us back to discuss further.

Thank you.
