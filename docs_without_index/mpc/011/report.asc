Hi, dev team:
    I am a cryptocurrency lover and I am interested in the anonymous transactions. The Tron has achieved great success and I want to be a member that can witness the historic moment TRONZ is implemented as an anonymous coin in the Tron public chain.
    I am a programmer and have written many codes about distributed systems. It is my honor that I can participate in the MPC.
    
Best regards!
